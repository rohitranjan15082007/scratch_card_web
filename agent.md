# Project Rules

## Stack
Python 3.11+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async,
Alembic, Pydantic v2, pytest, Celery + Redis, Docker Compose.

## Money Rules (CRITICAL)
- NEVER use float for money
- ALWAYS integer paise (₹1 = 100 paise)
- DB columns: BIGINT
- Every journal group must balance

## Spec Rules
- Follow SPEC.md (v1.2) exactly
- 50% rule = floor(B * 5000 / 10000)
- Threshold override = DISABLED by default
- One unresolved withdrawal per user
- Exact amount matching only (V1)
- No auto-release after payment exposure
- Screenshot alone cannot settle
- Backend enforces all state transitions

## Code Rules
- No business logic in routes
- Money logic only in app/services/
- All mutations require idempotency key
- All state changes require audit log
- Use SELECT FOR UPDATE for wallet/match
- Every service function has a test

## Never Do
- No float / Decimal for money
- No fake provider verification
- No frontend-driven state changes
- No partial matching in V1
- No silent ledger edits (use reversals)

## Tests
- Every SPEC section 16 test must exist
- pytest with async support
- Concurrency tests with asyncio.gather
- Idempotency tests call twice
